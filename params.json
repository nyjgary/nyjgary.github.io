{"name":"Gary's foray into data science","tagline":"Transitioning from management consulting to data science","body":"_Hello! I am a recent MBA graduate from The University of Chicago, currently working in management consulting and looking to transition into data science. I have been ramping up my knowledge on R, Python, and data science through a variety of online resources. Below is a collection of projects that chart my journey and showcase skills I've have learnt._   \r\n\r\n### Peeking into the world of P2P lending with Prosper data \r\nAn exploratory data analysis of Prosper's 2005-2014 loan-level data, this study seeks to explore the characteristics of typical borrowers, nature of loans originated, and growth trajectory of the nation's first peer-to-peer lending marketplace. This project is coded in R and employs heavy usage of ggplot2, as well as other R packages like maps, dplyr, and reshape2.

In this project, we learnt to apply simple machine learning techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn, analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias, and evaluate a modelâ€™s performance on unseen data using previous data.

Through graphical plots and summary statistics, this study explores variables affecting the likelihood of surviving the tragedy, including age, gender as well as other less obvious factors.
