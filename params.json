I am a management consultant with an MBA from The University of Chicago looking to transition into data science. I have been learning R, Python, machine learning and other data science concepts through online resources. Below is a collection of some data science projects I have completed that chart my learning journey and showcase some of the skills I have learnt._\r\n\r\n### Peeking into the world of P2P lending with Prosper data \r\nAn exploratory data analysis of Prosper's 2005-2014 loan-level data, this study seeks to explore the characteristics of typical borrowers, nature of loans originated, and growth trajectory of the nation's first peer-to-peer lending marketplace.

Through graphical plots and summary statistics, this study explores variables affecting the likelihood of surviving the tragedy, including age, gender as well as other less obvious factors.
